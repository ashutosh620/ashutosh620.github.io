Abstract
---
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are becoming increasingly
popular for image processing tasks. Researchers
have started using GANs for speech enhancement, but the
advantage of using the GAN framework has not been established
for speech enhancement. For example, a recent study
reports encouraging enhancement results, but we find that the
architecture of the generator used in the GAN gives better
performance when it is trained alone using the $L_1$ loss. This
work presents a new GAN for speech enhancement, and obtains
performance improvement with the help of adversarial
training. A deep neural network (DNN) is used for timefrequency
mask estimation, and it is trained in two ways:
regular training with the $L_1$ loss and training using the GAN
framework with the help of an adversary discriminator. Experimental
results suggest that the GAN framework improves
speech enhancement performance. Further exploration of loss
functions, for speech enhancement, suggests that the $L_1$ loss
is consistently better than the $L_2$ loss for improving the perceptual
quality of noisy speech.
