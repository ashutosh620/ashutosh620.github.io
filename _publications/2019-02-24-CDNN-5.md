Abstract
---
A recent study has demonstrated the effectiveness of complexvalued deep neural networks (CDNNs) using newly developed tools such as complex batch normalization and complex
residual blocks. Motivated by the fact that CDNNs are well
suited for the processing of complex-domain representations,
we explore CDNNs for speech enhancement. In particular, we train a CDNN that learns to map the complex-valued
noisy short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to the clean STFT.
Additionally, we propose the complex-valued extensions of
the parametric rectified linear unit (PReLU) nonlinearity
that helps to improve the performance of CDNN. Experimental results demonstrate that a CDNN using the proposed
nonlinearity can give similar or better enhancement results
compared to real-valued deep neural networks (DNNs).
