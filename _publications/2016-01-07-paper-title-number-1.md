Abstract
---
The objective of this work is to establish the
importance of speaker information present in the glottal regions
of speech signal. In addition, its robustness for degraded data
and significance for limited data is sought for the task of speaker
verification. An adaptive threshold method is proposed to use on
zero frequency filtered signal to get the glottal activity regions.
Feature vectors are extracted from regions having significant
glottal activity. An i-vector based speaker verification system is
developed using NIST SRE 2003 database and the performance
of proposed method is evaluated in degraded and limited data
condition. Robustness of proposed method is tested for white
and babble noise. Further, short utterances of test data are
considered to evaluate the performance in limited data condition.
The proposed method based on the selection of glottal regions
is found to perform better than the baseline energy based voice
activity detection method in degraded and limited data conditions.
