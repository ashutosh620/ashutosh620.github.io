I currently serve as a research scientist within the Meta Reality Labs Research Audio team. My educational background includes a Ph.D. in computer science obtained from The Ohio State University, where I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor [DeLiang Wang](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.77/). Additionally, I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/).

My primary research focus lies in addressing challenges related to enhancing human listening experiences in demanding conditions, with a keen interest in reducing the cognitive effort required for auditory perception.
