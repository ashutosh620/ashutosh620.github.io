I am a PhD student in [Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory (PNL)](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/pnl/) at The Ohio State University, in the department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I am advised by Professor [DeLiang Wang](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.77/). I received my bachelor's degree, Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.), in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/).

I was recently awarded **Presidential Fellowship** by The Ohio State University for the academic term 2021-2022.
 
I am broadly interested in speech enhancement/separation, robust automatic speech recognition, machine learning and deep learning.
