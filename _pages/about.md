I am PhD student in [Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory (PNL)](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/pnl/) at The Ohio State University, in the department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I am advised by professor [Deliang Wang](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.77/).
 
My research is on supervised speech separation using deep learning.
